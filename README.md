# Towers-of-Hanoi

Description: This code uses stacks and the curses library to replicate a game of Hanoi. It was written using C.

The Towers of a Hanoi is a puzzle game that consists of three towers or rods and a number of disks of distinct sizes. Initially, all of the disks are on the first rod in order of decreasing size with the smallest disk on the top. The goal of the puzzle is to move all of the disks from the first rod to the third rod subject to the following constraints:

1.) In a single step, you may move a single disk found on the top of one of the stacks by placing it on top of another stack.

2.) You may not move a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
